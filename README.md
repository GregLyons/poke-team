# Bill's PC

A new way to build competitive Pok√©mon teams. Beta release available [here](https://billspc.dev) now!

I've been posting about my progress on this project from its beginning in January, as well as about [`poke-gql`](https://github.com/GregLyons/poke-gql) (the backend) in this [thread](https://www.smogon.com/forums/threads/poke-gql-a-new-pokemon-api-edit-also-new-project-reveal-in-the-replies.3695158/) on the Smogon forums.

This is built on the work in [`poke-db`](https://github.com/GregLyons/poke-gql) and [`poke-gql`](https://github.com/GregLyons/poke-gql). As with those repos, I have put `README.md` files throughout to help explain at a birds-eye view what's going on in their respective directories.
