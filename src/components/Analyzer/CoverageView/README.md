# General structure

The `TeamColumn` directory contains components for the team display on the left-hand side of the screen, while the other four directories handle the tables to be displayed.

When the user hovers over a cell in one of the table components, corresponding entries in the `TeamColumn` component need to be highlighted/de-highlighted so that the user can see which factors contribute to the value in that cell. This is handled in the `CoverageView` component.
