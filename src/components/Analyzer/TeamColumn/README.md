# General structure

The `TeamColumn` component serves as a wrapper for the individual `TeamColumnMember`s. Each of these latter components has components for their ability, item, and moveset. Clicking on these components will pull up an approprite `PopupSearch` component, which will allow the user to quickly modify their team members.
