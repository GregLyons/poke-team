# General structure

The folder structure is as follows:

- `CoverageView`: displays a table for the current team's type matchups, as well as other tables for field control (entry hazards, terrain, weather), statuses (in how many ways can the team inflict/resist status effects), and speed control (what forms of speed control does the team have?).
- `Versus`: users can import an opposing team to go up against their current team, and the app will calculate how they match against each other (how much damage does each move do against each member, etc.).
